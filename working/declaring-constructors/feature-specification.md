Version 0.1 (see [CHANGELOG](#CHANGELOG) at end)

Experiment flag: declaring-constructors

Provide a less redundant way to declare instance fields and initialize them from
corresponding constructor parameters.

## Introduction

It's a tenet of object-oriented programming that instances of a class are
created by going through a constructor that the class itself defines. This gives
the class the opportunity to validate or process parameters and ensure that the
new instance is in a valid, meaningful state.

Constructors allow a class to fully encapsulate its fields: A class's stored
instance fields may have little or no correspondence to the parameters passed to
the constructor. A class can change how it stores its fields without breaking
the class's public API. Constructors are an important abstraction facility.

But that layer of abstraction is not without cost. While constructors *can* do
all sorts of interesting computation to derive their instance field values from
the given parameters, in practice most fields are directly initialized from a
corresponding parameter. In that common case, the amount of boilerplate to
define a class that takes in and stores some state is large.

Here is a trivial widget class (based on [this comparison of Jetpack Compose,
SwiftUI, and Flutter][jetpack]):

[jetpack]: https://www.jetpackcompose.app/compare-declarative-frameworks/JetpackCompose-vs-SwiftUI-vs-Flutter

```dart
class ExampleComponent extends StatelessWidget {
  final String displayString;

  ExampleComponent({required String displayString})
    : displayString = displayString;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Text(displayString);
  }
}
```

The class stores a single field which is initialized by a corresponding
parameter in the constructor. The author of this class has to write the name
`displayString` four times, its type `String` twice, and the class name
`ExampleComponent` twice.

For many years, Dart has had a feature called "initializing formals" which
helps:

```dart
class ExampleComponent extends StatelessWidget {
  final String displayString;

  ExampleComponent({required this.displayString});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Text(displayString);
  }
}
```

Now you don't have to say the type twice since the constructor parameter's type
is inferred from the field's. You only have to write `displayName` twice instead
of four times. You still have to write `ExampleComponent` twice. And you have to
explicitly declare both the instance field and the constructor parameter.

Can we do better?

This proposal adds *declaring constructors* to Dart. A declaring constructor
implicitly declares one or more instance fields based on corresponding
constructor parameters. Each implicitly declared field takes its name and type
from the corresponding parameter, and is implicitly initialized to that
parameter's argument value when the constructor is called.

Also, declaring constructors eliminate the annoying need to repeat the class
name, which may be long. With this proposal, the example widget class becomes:

```dart
class ExampleComponent extends StatelessWidget {
  this({required final String displayString});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Text(displayString);
  }
}
```

That's not a monumental improvement in this toy example, but the value becomes
more noticeable in a larger (but still small) real-world example:

```dart
// Before:
class ClipboardHistoryItem extends StatefulWidget {
  final DictionaryHistoryEntry entry;
  final CreatorCallback creatorCallback;
  final VoidCallback stateCallback;

  final ScrollController dictionaryScroller;
  final ValueNotifier<double> dictionaryScrollOffset;

  ClipboardHistoryItem(
    this.entry,
    this.creatorCallback,
    this.stateCallback,
    this.dictionaryScroller,
    this.dictionaryScrollOffset,
  );

  @override
  _ClipboardHistoryItemState createState() {
    // ...
  }
}

// After:
class ClipboardHistoryItem extends StatefulWidget {
  this(
    final DictionaryHistoryEntry entry,
    final CreatorCallback creatorCallback,
    final VoidCallback stateCallback,
    final ScrollController dictionaryScroller,
    final ValueNotifier<double> dictionaryScrollOffset,
  );

  @override
  _ClipboardHistoryItemState createState() {
    // ...
  }
}
```

The class (granted with a method body elided) gets about 1/3 shorter. If you'd
like to see more real-world examples, I've taken a random sample of Dart classes
and [migrated them to this proposal][sample].

[sample]: https://github.com/munificent/temp-declaring-constructors/commit/0c38f2029783dde4c09041ef6056fe4939d77bdc

The proposal is a simple dollop of syntactic sugar. The basics are:

*   A **declaring constructor** is defined using `this` instead of the class
    name. A class may have only one.

*   Each parameter in the constructor's parameter list marked `final` or `var`
    is a **field parameter**. Each field parameter implicitly declares an
    instance field with the same name, type, and finality as the parameter.

*   The implicitly declared fields are automatically initialized by the
    corresponding field parameter value when the constructor is called.

*   Parameters in a declaring constructor not marked `final` or `var` are
    normal constructor parameters and don't declare fields. They can be used in
    the constructor's initializer list or body as usual.

### Compared to primary ctors

We've been discussing ways to reduce the verbosity around fields and
constructors for years. Another proposal aimed at the same problem is [primary
constructors][]. There are a few differences. In short, I think primary
constructors scale down better, while declaring constructors scale up better.

[primary constructors]: https://github.com/dart-lang/language/blob/main/working/2364%20-%20primary%20constructors/feature-specification.md

Primary constructors are hard to beat when the class is a very simple "plain-old
data structure" class that is effectively a nominal record or bag of fields:

```dart
// Before:
class ShoppingCartItem {
  final String name;
  final String skuNumber;
  final Currency unitPrice;
  int purchaseQuantity;

  ShoppingCartItem(
    this.name,
    this.skuNumber,
    this.unitPrice,
    this.purchaseQuantity,
  );
}

// This proposal:
class ShoppingCartItem {
  this(
    final String name,
    final String skuNumber,
    final Currency unitPrice,
    var int purchaseQuantity,
  );
}

// Primary constructors:
class PurchasedItem(
  final String name,
  final String skuNumber,
  final Currency unitPrice,
  int purchaseQuantity,
);
```

With a primary constructor, the fields are in the class header before the body.
That means they don't end up nested and indented twice, once for the body and
once for the parameter list.

Since *all* parameters in a primary constructor implicitly declare fields, you
don't need a marker keyword like `final` or `var` to distinguish field
parameters from non-field parameters. However, you *do* still need a marker to
specify the finality of the field. In practice, about 2/3 of primary constructor
parameters will still end up needing `final` since immutability is more common.
But for the 1/3 of fields that are mutable, primary constructors avoid the `var`
that this proposal requires.

There are real brevity advantages to primary constructors. But that brevity
comes with trade-offs. A primary constructor can't have a body, initializer
list, of explicit superclass constructor call. If you need any of those, you're
back to needing a regular in-body constructor.

A declaring constructor like in this proposal *is* an in-body constructor, so
it has none of those limitations. A class author can *always* make one of a
class's generative constructors be declaring if they want to.

In a large corpus of pub packages and open source Flutter applications, about
22% of existing constructors wouldn't work with the primary constructors
proposal because they have a body, explicit initializer list, etc. (On the other
hand, the fact that ~77% of constructors could still be primary constructors and
be even *more* terse than this proposal is a point in favor of that proposal.)

I like to think of this feature as syntactic sugar for *instance fields*, not
constructors. A class whose constructor initializes 80 fields will find either
of these proposals 80 times more useful than a class with just one field. If
you look at a corpus and count fields, the numbers are a little different.

In the same corpus, a little more than half (~53%) of all instance fields could
be implicitly declared using a primary constructor. Around ~65% could be
declared using this proposal. (The remaining ~35% of instance fields aren't
directly initialized from constructor parameters, so aren't helped by either
proposal.)

While these proposals are aimed at the same problem, they aren't necessarily
mutually exclusive. Their syntaxes don't collide so we could do both. Though
with factory constructors, redirecting constructors, initializing formals, and
super parameters, the amount of constructor-related syntactic sugar is getting a
little silly.

## Syntax

The syntax changes are smallâ€”just using `this` instead of the class name in a
constructor. But weaving it into the grammar is a little complicated because
some kinds of constructors can't be declaring:

```
classMemberDeclaration ::=
  // Existing clauses...
  | declaringConstructor // Added.

declaringConstructor ::=
  declaringConstructorSignature initializers? (functionBody | ';')

declaringConstructorSignature ::=
  'const'? 'this' ('.' identifier)? formalParameterList
```

*We add a new clause to `classMemberDeclaration` for a declaring constructor. A
declaring constructor must be generative (not `factory`). Since factory
constructors have no `this`, there is no instance to implicitly initialize from
the parameter. A declaring constructor can be `const` or not. It can't be
redirecting. It also can't be `external` since an external constructor has no
implicit initializer list or body where the fields could be initialized.*

## Static semantics

This feature is just syntactic sugar for things the user can already express,
so there are no interesting new semantics.


Given a `declaringConstructor` D in class C:

*   For each parameter P in its formal parameter list list:

    *   If P has a `final` or `var` modifier, it is a **field parameter**:

        *   Implicitly declare an instance field F on the surrounding class with
            the same name and type as P. *If P has no type, it implicitly has
            type `dynamic`, as does F.*

        *   If P is `final`, then the instance field is also `final`.

        *   Any doc comments and metadata annotations on P are also copied to F.
            *For example, a user could mark the parameter `@override` if the
            the implicitly declared field overrides an inherited getter.*

        *   P comes an initializing formal that initializes F.

    *Note that a declaring constructor doesn't have to have any field
    parameters. A user still may want to use the feature just to use `this`
    instead of `SomePotentiallyLongClassName` to define the constructor.*

It is a compile-time error if:

*   A class has more than one declaring constructor. *If we allowed multiple,
    we'd have to decide what it meant for them to declare overlapping or
    non-overlapping field parameters. Any choice here is likely to be confusing
    for users. In practice, most classes have only a single generative
    constructor.*

    *A class can have a declaring constructor along with as many other
    generative and factory constructors as its author wants.*

*   The implicitly declared fields would lead to an erroneous class. *For
    example if the class has a `const` constructor but one of the field
    parameters induces a non-`final` field, or an induced field collides with
    another member of the same name.

*   An implicitly declared field is also explicitly initialized in the declaring
    constructor's initializer list. *This is really just a restatement of the
    previous point since it's an error for a field to be initialized both by an
    initializing formal and in the initializer list.*

*   A field parameter is named `_`. *We could allow this but... why?*

## Runtime semantics

There are no runtime semantics for this feature.

## Compatibility

The identifier `this` is already a reserved word that can't appear at this
point in the grammar, so this is a non-breaking change that doesn't affect any
existing code.

However, it does introduce a potential source of confusion. It's already
possible to mark a parameter `final`. (Doing so simply makes the parameter
non-assignable.) It's also possible to annotate a parameter using `var` (but
not with a type annotation after).

With this feature, users may expect that syntax when used outside of a declaring
constructor to do something like what it does inside a declaring constructor's
parameter list. In practice, `final` is rare on parameters and `var` is
virtually unknown:

```
-- Parameter (3992112 total) --
3948862 ( 98.917%): neither  ===================================================
  42450 (  1.063%): final    =
    800 (  0.020%): var      =
```

(More than half of the occurrences of `var` parameters are in a single pub
package. More than 82% are in only five packages, so this seems to be something
a *very* small number of authors use.)

So while the potential for confusion is there, I think it's unlikely to be a
problem in practice.

### Language versioning

Even this change it's non-breaking, it is language versioned and can only be
used in libraries whose language version is at or later than the version this
feature ships in. This is mainly to ensure that users don't inadvertently try to
use this feature in packages whose SDK constraint allows older Dart SDK versions
that don't support the feature.

## Tooling

The best language features are designed holistically with the entire user
experience in mind, including tooling and diagnostics. This section is *not
normative*, but is merely a suggestion for the implementation teams.

### Quick fix

This feature makes common idioms more concise, so users would almost certainly
want to use it, and we want them to. An automated quick fix can make that
easier.

The process to turn an existing generative constructor into a declaring
constructor is something like:

1.  For each initializing formal whose type is the same as the corresponding
    field:

    1.  Move any type annotation, doc coment, and metadata annotation from the
        field to the formal parameter.

    2.  Add `final` if the field is `final` or `var` otherwise and remove the
        `this.`.

    3.  Remove the field declaration.

I suspect this feature is better as a human-initiated quick fix than a
large-scale automated migration. It's not always clear when a constructor should
become a declaring one:

*   If the class has only one constructor but the constructor doesn't have any
    initializing formals, should it still become declaring? `this` is probably
    shorter than the class name, but is that worth it?

*   If the class has multiple generative constructors, which one becomes
    declaring? Probably the one with the most initializing formals, but what do
    you do in case there's a tie?
